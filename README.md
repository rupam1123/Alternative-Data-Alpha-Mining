# Alternative-Data-Alpha-Mining
alpha trading
The goal of this project is to explore whether alternative data sources such as social media sentiment and search engine trends can be used to predict short-term stock returns more effectively than traditional models. By developing predictive models and testing them via backtesting frameworks, we aim to identify alpha-generating signals that can be used in quantitative trading strategies.
